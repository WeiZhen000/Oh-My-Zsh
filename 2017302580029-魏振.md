P5. 

     a. Solution:

                The time required for the tollbooth to push the entire caravan onto the highway is 
(10 cars)*(12 s/car) = 120 seconds = 2 minutes. The time required for a car to travel from the exit of one tollbooth to the
next tollbooth is 150 km/(100 km/hour) = 1.5 hours = 90 minutes. Therefore, the time from when the caravan is stored in front 
of a tollbooth until the caravan is stored in front of the next tollbooth is (90 minutes) + (2 minutes) = 92 minutes. In this 
question, total time should contains the time when the caravan is stored in front of first tollbooth until the caravan is 
stored in front of second tollbooth, the time when the caravan is stored in front of second tollbooth until the caravanis 
stored in front of third tollbooth and the time required for the third tollbooth to push the entire caravan onto the highway, 
that is

                          92 minutes + 92 minutes + 2 minutes = 186 minutes

     b. Solution:

                 In question b, we can just change the time required for the tollbooth to push the entire caravan onto the 
highway to (8 cars)*(12 s/car) = 1.6 minutes in question a. So the total time is

                          (90 minutes + 1.6 minutes) *2 + 1.6 minutes = 184.8 minutes



P6. 

        a. d<sub>prop</sub> = m / s seconds

        b. d<sub>trans</sub> = L / R seconds

        c.  t<sub>end-to-end</sub> = d<sub>prop</sub> + d<sub>trans</sub> = (m/s + L/R) seconds

        d. The last bit of the packet is just leaving Host A.

        e. The first bit of the packet is between Host A and Host B.

        f.  The first bit of the packet has reached Host B.

        g. Solution:

	      From the question, we have that

		                 d<sub>prop</sub> = m / s seconds = m / (2.5 &times; 10<sup>8</sup> ) seconds

		                 d<sub>trans</sub> = L / R seconds = (120 bits) / (56 kbps)

	      Let d<sub>prop</sub> = d<sub>trans</sub> , we have the solution m that make d<sub>prop</sub> = d<sub>trans</sub>

		                                m = 536 km



P22. 

       Solution: From the question we have the packet loss probability *p*, and each link is independent, so the probability 
that a packet is successfully received by the receiver is 

                                            P = (1 - p)<sup>n</sup> 

        The average times that the server re-transmit the packet is
$$
\sum_{k=0}^\infty k[1-(1-p)^n]^k(1-p)^n
$$
